# `Http Rocket Project`

Rocket is an asynchronous http application framework based on Netty 
framework (https://github.com/netty/netty) and Reactor Project framework
(https://github.com/reactor/reactor). Rocket takes advantage of both and provides an easy to use tool 
for building fast and efficient http applications.
